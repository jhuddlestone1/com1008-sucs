		<h1>Societies</h1>
		
		<h2>What societies can I get involved with?</h2>
		<img src="photos/su_activities.JPG" alt="SU Activities & Sports Zone" title="SU Activities & Sports Zone">
		<p>There are so many Computer Science related societies at Sheffield I
		know you'll have a hard time deciding which ones not to join!</p>
	  
		<h4>Artificial Intelligence Society</h4>
		<p>The Artificial Intelligence Society are always hosting a wide range of interesting
		talks, workshops and presentations about AI. If you know nothing about AI and want to 
		learn more or even if you think you know everything there is to know, the Artificial
		Intelligence Society would love you to join. 
		<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SheffAISoc/" title="AI Society">Find out more</a> here.</p>
		
		<h4>Computer Science Society</h4>
		<p>The Computer Science Society host loads of different events mostly relating to
		coding. They hold events such as GameJam where everyone competes in teams (or by 
		yourself if you want a challenge) to make a game. They even hold mentoring sessions
		for help with all your Computer Science needs. <a href="https://shefcompsoc.uk/" title="Sheffield CompSoc">
		Find out more</a> here.</p>
		
		<h4>Give It A Go</h4>
		<p>Give It A Go is technically not a society, it is more of an event programme which holds
		the biggest range of events anywhere in the Students' Union. Want to learn how to knit? 
		Or go out for a run? Or even learn how to run a cinema? I would highly recommed at least
		having a <a href="https://tickets.sheffieldstudentsunion.com/give-it-a-go/" title="Give It A Go">
		look through their website</a> as I'm sure there will be at least a few things which grab your eye.</p>
		
		<h4>HackSheffield</h4>
		<p>HackSheffield - contrary to the name - is not where you go to learn how to be a cyber criminal
		and learn to hack your way through anything, they mostly hold events where you get together in a 
		team with the sole aim of coding your way to completing a certain task or project. Not only that, 
		but they also provide free food, so if you're into food, coding or ideally both, you should
		<a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/groups/hacksheffield" title="HackSheffield">check them out</a>.</p>
		
		<h4>Sheffield Roboteers</h4>
		<p>If you've ever watched Robot Wars and wanted to be a part of it then this is definitely the society
		for you. Roboteers create fighting ant-weight robots and let them fight in events throughout the year.
		They also hold many interesting talks on robotics and robotics-related subjects. So if robots are your
		thing then this is where you should be. 
		<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/181120472342076/" title="Sheffield Roboteers">

		<h4>Sheffield Bionics</h4>
		<p>Sheffield Bionics focus on the creation of prosthetic legs and arms and brain-computer interfaces.
		This year they plan on creating a fully functional prosthetic leg and then next year 
		moving on to creating a brain-computer interface in the form of an EEG. They hold regular 
		talks on various subjects to do with bionics and accessibility and it is definitely worth
		<a href="http://sheffieldbionics.group.shef.ac.uk/" title="Sheffield Bionics">checking out their website</a>
		for a detailed description of their aims and objectives.</p>
		
		<h4>Sheffield Women in Computer Science</h4>
		<p>Sheffield Women in Computer Science is all about promoting women to join Computer Science.
		They host a range of events, talks, workshops and regualr socials. Sheffield Women in Computer 
		Science is open to everyone (even if you're not a woman) and you can
		<a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/groups/women-in-computer-science-c357" 
		title="Sheffield Women in Computer Science"> check them out here</a>.</p>
		
		<h4>SLUGS</h4>
		<p>SLUGS is all about video games and - let's be honest - a lot of computer scientists are also
		into gaming. SLUGS hold weekly socials where you can sit and game the night away with food,
		drinks and friends. They also host a range of gaming based events for all different systems
		so you'll definetly be able to introduce your favourite games to others and maybe find some
		great new games. So if you're into gaming <a href="https://slugsoc.co.uk/" title="SLUGS">
		check them out here</a>.</p>
