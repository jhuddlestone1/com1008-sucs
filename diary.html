		<h2>The week of a Computer Science student in the SU!</h2>
	  
		<h4>Monday</h4>
		<p>Today, I had a two hour break in between one of my lectures, so me 
		and my friends decided to go and get some pizza from Uni Central. It 
		was really nice! We sat and chatted for a bit and then decided to go 
		and have a look inside Our Shop. I didn't buy anything, but I think 
		tomorrow I am going to try one of their hot pasty things. They looked
		like they would be really good. We left Our Shop and realised that our
		lecture was going to start soon, so we had to leave.</p>
		
		<h4>Tuesday</h4>
		<p>Today, I had a one hour break between my lectures so I decided that
		I will try one of the pasty things I saw yesterday. I tried two, the 
		smoked ham and cheese and the tomato and mozzarella. Both of them were
		so good! I think this place is definitely where I'm going to get some
		food if I need something quickly. Although they don't sell any non-sparkling
		water... I picked up some water forgetting this and it was sparkling :( 
		I drank it still, but I would have preferred normal water. Must remember 
		to bring a bottle to use the water fountains next time!</p>
		
		<h4>Wednesday</h4>
		<p>Today, I didn't have much time to go into the Students' Union during
		the day, I quickly picked up a coffee from Coffee Revolution in the 
		morning as I was way too tired to function. Obviously I brought my own 
		water this time so that I did not have to buy sparkling water. In the 
		evening I had a club night planned - ROAR. They were playing such a good 
		range of songs and surprisingly I actually knew most of them playing. It 
		was definitely a good night out and it really makes you forget that this 
		is still a students' union!</p>
		
		<h4>Thursday</h4>
		<p>Today, I decided to try something a bit different. I had heard about the 
		bubble tea that was being sold and I thought it would be a good idea to try
		some. I decided to get a blueberry fruit tea with apple popping pearls and
		I was so surprised at how nice it actually is! I think I will be buying another one 
		of those soon. I also saw the pasty place just opposite and while I was waiting
		decided to get a classic Cornish Pasty (even though they had what seemed like a hundred
		different flavours). Afterwards, I quickly went upstairs to finish off and print
		out an assignment.</p>
		
		<h4>Friday</h4>
		<p>I didn't spend much time in the SU today. I quickly went in there to buy a new 
		notepad as I forgot mine had ran out. But after this, I didn't go there again today.</p>
		
		<h4>Saturday</h4>
		<p>Today, as it is a Saturday I didn't spend much time in the SU. But I did have another
		night out! I went to Pop Tarts this evening and had an amazing time! All the songs reminded
		me of my childhood and I really enjoyed singing along to them with all my friends. I think I 
		will go to Pop Tarts again as it really was a great night out :)</p>
		
		<h4>Sunday</h4>
		<p>Today I had a lot of work to do so I decided to go to the IC to make sure I got it 
		all done. I really enjoyed the pasty things I had earlier in the week, so before I started
		working I sat down with some of those pasty things and a coffee from Coffee Revolution. I wanted
		to go and get another one before I went home but it was too late so I couldn't go in there.</p>
