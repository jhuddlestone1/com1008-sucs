		<h1>Eat</h1>
	 
		<h2>Where can you get food in the Students' Union?</h2>
		<p>In the Students' Union you'll find such an amazing range of places
		to eat, you'll never want to get a Tesco meal deal again!</p>
		
		<h4>Bar One</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_barone2.JPG" alt="Bar One" title="Bar One">
		<p>Bar One is the go-to bar for most Students. If you're looking to go out to the 
		pub with your mates then this is the place for you. With a wide range of food and an even
		wider range of drinks, you can sit down with your friends, have a pint and a burger and watch
		the night disappear before you know it. And don't worry - there's plenty of vegan and 
		vegetarian options there too. Located on Glossop Road, opposite 301.<p>
		
		<h4>Coffee Revolution</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_coffeerevs.JPG" alt="Coffee Revolution" title="Coffee Revolution">
		<p>You ever feel like going to Starbucks between lectures, but then realise that it's just
		too far away? Then Coffee Revolution is the place for you! Selling all the coffee you could 
		ever desire, along with a range of little snacks to keep you going when you need that little
		bit of extra energy. Located on Level 3 of the Students Union.</p>
		
		<h4>Grill and Go</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_grillandgo.JPG" alt="Grill and Go" title="Grill and Go">
		<p>Grill and Go is one of the most popular lunch places in the Students' Union by far. There's not
		just one Grill and Go, there's two! Located on Level 3 of the Students' Union and in Uni Central on Level 4,
		you'll never be too far away from getting yourself a top-notch burrito or tortilla wrap.</p>
		
		<h4>Inox Dine</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_inox.JPG" alt="Inox Dine" title="Inox Dine">
		<p>Inox Dine is a little bit different to everything else on this list - it's not the place you'd go
		right before a night out, or for a quick bite between lectures. This is somewhere you can go to have 
		a celebration. Being more formal, Inox Dine offers dishes such as grilled fish or steak, and
		best of all, it is still extremely affordable. Located on Level 5 of the Students' Union.</p>
		
		<h4>Interval</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_interval.JPG" alt="Interval" title="Interval">
		<p>If Inox Dine is too formal for you but you still want that restaurant feeling, then Interval is
		where you should be. Out of all of the places on this list, this is where you will struggle the most
		to pick what to eat. With pizza, pasta, sandwiches and soup - to name a few - you'll definitely find
		yourself something to eat here. And of course, there's a whole menu dedicated to vegetarian and vegan
		options. Located next to the East entrance to the Students' Union.</p>
		
		<h4>New Leaf</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_newleaf.JPG" alt="New Leaf" title="New Leaf">
		<p>New Leaf, as you may be able to tell from the name, sells salad bowls. If you're on a diet or just love 
		to eat salad, then this is where you belong. The options are endless: there are so many toppings, dressings
		and garnishes to choose from, you'll definitely need a few minutes just to read through the entire menu. 
		Located on Level 3 of the Students' Union.</p>
		
		<h4>Pearls Bubble Tea</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_pearls.JPG" alt="Pearls Bubble Tea" title="Pearls Bubble Tea">
		<p>If you're looking for something that's completely different to anything you have ever tried before,
		then Pearls Bubble Tea should be top of your to-do list. You can get fruit tea or green tea or even Oreo tea
		with a load of little fruit flavoured popping pearls in them. I can guarantee you will have never tried
		anything like this ever before. Located on Level 3 of the Students' Union next to Santander.</p>
		
		<h4>Proper Pasty</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_properpasty.JPG" alt="Proper Pasty" title="Proper Pasty">
		<p>Sometimes we get cravings for different foods, and I'm certain that everyone has had a craving for
		a proper Cornish pasty - and as the name suggests - Proper Pasty is where that craving will be
		satisfied. With so many different types of pasty to choose from, there is no doubt that Proper Pasty
		sell the best pasties in Sheffield. Located on Level 3 of the Students' Union opposite Santander.</p>
		
		<h4>Uni Central</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_unicentral.JPG" alt="Uni Central" title="Uni Central">
		<p>Uni Central is home to the fast food of the Students' Union. You want a pizza? Or a burger and chips?
		Or even some fried chicken? Then Uni Central is the best place for you! Uni Central is undoubtedly the 
		most popular place in the Students' Union for food, so get there early - otherwise you might end up 
		sitting on the floor!</p>
		
		<h4>View Deli</h4>
		<img src="photos/su_viewdeli.JPG" alt="View Deli" title="View Deli">
		<p>If you're looking for somewhere that is exclusively vegan and vegetarian then The View Deli is where
		you should be. With their whole menu catering to vegans and vegetarians, everything single item on the menu
		will be both healthy and delicious!</p>
